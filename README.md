# Rogue Angels : Legacy of the Burning Suns Companion App

This is a visual novel style companion app for the board game Rogue Angels : Legacy of the Burning Suns, based on Ren'Py.

## What is Rogue Angels?
[Rogue Angels : Legacy of the Burning Suns](https://gamefound.com/en/projects/suntzugames/rogue-angels) (aka RA), is a board game developped by Sun Tzu Games. It is a campaign sci-fi crawler featuring rich story-telling and character development. The game features six large chapter books containing many scenarios with branching path and decision points. The physical game is designed to be played with the spiral book opened, and digital play like on [Tabletop Simulator](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2539276749) and [Tabletopia](https://tabletopia.com/games/rogue-angels) has the campaign chapters available as PDF.

## Why a companion app?
This projects aims at creating a companion application for RA that can replace the chapter book entirely. Other tabletop games like Mansions of Madness Second Edition use a companion app to reduce table clutter and deliver more immersive narrative thanks to the addition of music and sound effects. Companion Apps are great for campaign games particularly as it can track decisions, and obscure alternative or future effects, keeping the experience free of spoilers.

## How is this app made?
This fan-made companion app uses the [Ren'Py Visual Novel Engine](www.renpy.org) under the [MIT license](https://www.renpy.org/doc/html/license.html) to create scenes and deliver instructions to the players to set up the board, display objectives and deliver the story of RA. Ren'Py uses python as the framework's programming language, but also has its own simplified scripting language, making it very easy to learn and contribute with only a summary knowledge of programming.

## Current state of the app

At the moment only the introduction sequence and mission C1 is implemented. Creating these scenarios manually is a lot of work and very time consuming. I'm looking into ways to automate some of the script generation.

## TODO
* All the scenarios
* Visually differ between talking *on comm* and *in-person*
* Better assets for characters
* Better Main Menu
* More intro animation (panning)
* Mission Select screen
* AI voice overs?
