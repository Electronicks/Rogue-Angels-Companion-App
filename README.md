### Rogue Angels : Legacy of the Burning Suns Companion App

Rogue Angels : Legacy of the Burning Suns (aka RA), is a board game developped by Sun Tzu Games. It is a campaign sci-fi crawler featuring rich story-telling and character development. The game features six large chapter books containing many scenarios with branching path and decision points. The physical game is designed to be played with the spiral book opened, and digital play like on Tabletop Simulator and Tabletopia has the campaign chapters available as PDF.

This projects aims at creating a companion application for RA that can replace the chapter book entirely. Other tabletop games like Mansions of Madness Second Edition use a companion app to reduce table clutter and deliver more immersive narrative with the addition of music and sound effects.

This fan-made companion app uses the Ren'Py Visual Novel engine to create scenes and deliver instructions to the players as to how to set up the board, display objectives and deliver the story of RA. Ren'Py uses python as the framework's programming language, but also has its own simplified scripting language, making it very easy to learn and contribute with only a summary knowledge of programming.

This projects is looking for volunteers to add more scenarios to the project.
